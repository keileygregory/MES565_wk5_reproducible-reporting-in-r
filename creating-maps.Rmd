This week you will create a map for publication in a DPNR pamphlet showing the locations of the proposed moorings (week 4 exercise). I will give you all the layers needed for the map on One Drive so you can focus on just creating a map.

Your map will need to include the following features..

1.  Main map

2.  Map inset

3.  Graticules (Lat-Lon marks or grid lines). Use decimal degrees

4.  Scale bar

5.  North Arrow

6.  Title

7.  Legend

8.  Annotations

9.  Finally, export the map as a JPEG
